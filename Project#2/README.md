# Data Analysis with Power BI: Exploring Sales, Profits for business

## Introduction

This project is my second venture into using Power BI, a powerful data visualization and business intelligence tool. I've sourced data from a public dataset provided by 
[Data Science Tutorials on a  Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwteCRMYJuA&list=PLSj0xkpVG0ovX70-Esr-r7ke-NjeqdqXF&index=3), focusing on business performances. The goal is to leverage Power Query and Power BI functionalities to uncover insights.

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Source and Preparation
- **Source**: [Data Science Tutorials on a  Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwteCRMYJuA&list=PLSj0xkpVG0ovX70-Esr-r7ke-NjeqdqXF&index=3)
- **Preparation**: Basically i cleaned the data  using the Query BI.
### 2. Analysis Overview
Addressing the following questions:
- How the sales performance vary across time?
- Which are the most sold categories?
- Which are the top 10 customers in a given time window?
- Is possible to inspect the details of a single row element?

### 3. Visualization tools
Differently from the first project,
here I learnt how to use visualization fiters to give a dynamic view of different elements.
