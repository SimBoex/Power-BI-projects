# Data Analysis with Power BI: Exploring Job Trends, Satisfaction, and Preferences in the Tech Industry

## Introduction

This project is my first venture into using Power BI, a powerful data visualization and business intelligence tool. I've sourced data from a public dataset provided by [AlexTheAnalyst on GitHub](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Power-BI/blob/main/Power%20BI%20-%20Final%20Project.xlsx), focusing on job trends and preferences within the tech industry. The goal is to leverage Power Query and Power BI functionalities to uncover insights into job satisfaction, gender distribution in data-related jobs, programming language preferences, and educational backgrounds in various tech roles.

### 2. Analysis Overview
Addressing the following questions:
- Are data-related jobs predominantly held by men?
